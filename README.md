# CodiceFiscale
A Java GUI application in italian that lets you generate a Codice Fiscale (unique ID for every Italian citizen).

I'm stil very new to programming (less than a year's experience), and this is my very first thing done with Java Swing, so don't expect much.
I created this just beacuse I wanted to try and learn something about Swing, while still applying it to something that actually has a real use,
like a Codice Fiscale generator.

All comments and Javadocs are in Italian (for now).
